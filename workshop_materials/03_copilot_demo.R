# Malaria Data Analysis: Copilot-Assisted Approach
# Workshop: AI-Augmented R Coding
# Authors: Billy Quilty & Stefan Flasche

# This script demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can assist with R coding
# Try typing the comments below and see how Copilot suggests code!

# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)

# Load the malaria dataset
# TODO: Load the malaria dataset from Epi R Handbook

# Data exploration
# TODO: Explore the structure of the malaria dataset

# Data transformation
# TODO: Calculate age group proportions and reporting delays

# Create weekly aggregates
# TODO: Group data by week and district

# Plot 1: Total cases over time
# TODO: Create a line plot showing weekly cases by district

# Plot 2: Age group distribution
# TODO: Create an area plot showing age group proportions over time

# Plot 3: Reporting delay analysis
# TODO: Create a plot showing reporting delays by district

# Statistical analysis
# TODO: Compare districts and identify peak periods

# Summary statistics
# TODO: Calculate summary statistics by district and age group

# Save plots
# TODO: Save all plots as PNG files

# This is where Copilot really shines - try typing natural language comments
# and watch it generate the appropriate R code!

# For example, try typing:
# "Create a bar chart showing total cases by district"
# "Calculate the correlation between age groups"
# "Create a heatmap of cases by week and district"
# "Filter data for the highest transmission period"

# Copilot will suggest code based on your comments and context!
